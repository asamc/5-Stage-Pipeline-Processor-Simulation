#5 stage pipeline processor simulation with data hazard detection and forwarding
#=========================================================================================================

#=========================================================================================================
#                                           Overview:
#=========================================================================================================
#1.Programs - creates three instruction sets for different pipeline cases
#2.Forwarding Runs - runs each test with forwarding off and on
#3.Setup Pipeline - stores IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB for each cycle
#4.Cycle Simulation - moves instructions through the pipeline stages
#5.Hazards - checks source registers for RAW data hazards
#6.Stalls - holds instructions when a needed register is not ready
#7.Forwarding - changes timing when destination registers become ready
#8.Output - prints instructions, pipeline table, stalls, and CPI of all programs
#=========================================================================================================
